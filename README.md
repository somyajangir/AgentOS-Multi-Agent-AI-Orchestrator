A sophisticated Multi-Agent System built with **Hono**, **React**, and **Google GenAI**, featuring a centralized Router Agent that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (Support, Order, Billing).

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a scalable **Controller-Service architecture** where a "Parent" Router Agent analyzes user intent and routes queries to the appropriate "Child" Agent. It features a Neo-Brutalist frontend, real-time reasoning visualization, and robust error handling.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

User → Frontend (React) → Router Agent (Intent Classification)
                                   ↓
        ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐
        ↓               ↓               ↓
   Support Agent    Order Agent     Billing Agent

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Modern AI systems require orchestration across multiple specialized agents rather than relying on a single monolithic model. 

This project demonstrates:
- Intelligent intent classification
- Agent-based task delegation
- Context preservation across turns
- Rate-limited production-style architecture
- Transparent AI reasoning visualization

It simulates how enterprise-grade AI systems are structured.

### ✨ Key Features

-   **🧠 Intelligent Routing:** The **Router Agent** uses hybrid heuristic/AI analysis to classify intent (Order vs. Billing vs. Support) with fallback handling.
-   **🤖 Specialized Sub-Agents:**
    -   **Support Agent:** Handles general inquiries and FAQs using context-aware responses.
    -   **Order Agent:** Manages order status, tracking, and modifications.
    -   **Billing Agent:** Resolves payment issues, refunds, and invoice queries.
-   **⚡ High Performance:** Built on **Hono** for ultra-fast edge-ready routing.
-   **⏳ Rate Limiting:** Global `TokenBucket` implementation to prevent abuse (Token refilling algorithm).
-   **🔄 Context Awareness:** Agents receive full conversation history to maintain context across turns.
-   **👁️ Reasoning Transparency:** Frontend visualizes the agent's "thought process" (steps) before showing the final reply.
-   **🎨 Neo-Brutalist UI:** A distinct, high-contrast design system using TailwindCSS.

## 🚀 Implemented Milestones

### ✅ Core Requirements
-   [x] **Multi-Agent System:** Implemented Router, Support, Order, and Billing agents.
-   [x] **Controller-Service Pattern:** Clean separation of route handling (`chat.js`) and business logic (`routerAgent.js`).
-   [x] **Error Handling:** Robust middleware and try/catch blocks with user-friendly error messages.
-   [x] **Agent Tools:** Sub-agents have access to tools (e.g., `queryConversationHistory`).
-   [x] **Context Management:** Full conversation history passed to agents for stateful interactions.

### 🌟 Bonus Achievements
-   [x] **Rate Limiting:** Custom `TokenBucket` algorithm implemented in the Router to manage load.
-   [x] **Reasoning Visualization:** "Thinking" steps (e.g., "Analyzing intent...") are streamed and animated in the UI.
-   [x] **Context Management:** Agents utilize previous conversation messages to inform responses.
-   [x] **Services Setup:** Modular structure allowing independent development of agents.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Chat Router (`/api/chat`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/messages` | Send a new message. Routes to appropriate agent. |
| `GET` | `/conversations` | List all user conversations. |
| `GET` | `/conversations/:id` | Get full history of a specific conversation. |
| `DELETE` | `/conversations/:id` | Delete a conversation. |

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   PostgreSQL
-   Google Gemini API Key / OpenRouter Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
2.  **Install dependencies** for each service:
    ```bash
    cd router && npm install
    cd ../frontend && npm install
    # Repeat for billing, order, support
    ```
3.  **Database Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd router
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma db push
    npx prisma db seed # Seeds initial data
    ```
4.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create `.env` files in `router`, `support`, etc., based on requirements (PORT, DATABASE_URL, API_KEYS).

### Running the System

1.  **Start the Router:**
    ```bash
    cd router && npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Start Sub-Agents:**
    Run `npm run dev` in `support`, `order`, and `billing` directories.
3.  **Start Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend && npm run dev
    ```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the Agent OS!
